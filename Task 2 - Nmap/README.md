# Nmap Scan Report

This repository contains the results and documentation of an Nmap scan performed on `demo.testfire.net`. The scan was conducted to analyze the host’s network exposure, identify open ports, detect running services, and estimate the target’s operating system.

## Overview

Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. This project demonstrates how various Nmap techniques can be combined to create a detailed profile of a target system.

## Scan Objectives

- Verify if the target is live and reachable  
- Identify open ports and running services  
- Detect service versions for better insight  
- Perform OS fingerprinting to estimate the host’s operating system  
- Conduct a full port scan to detect services outside the default range  

## Key Findings

- **Host Status:** Target is live and responding to requests  
- **Open Ports:** Multiple ports were detected as open and running services  
- **Service Details:** Version detection revealed specific software information  
- **OS Fingerprinting:** Estimated operating system successfully identified  
- **Full Scan Results:** No hidden open ports beyond the standard range were found  

## Conclusion

The scan provided a comprehensive understanding of the host’s network configuration and potential security exposures. Nmap is an essential tool for administrators and security analysts to monitor their systems and ensure that only authorized services are accessible.
