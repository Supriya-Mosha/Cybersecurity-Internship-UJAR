# Website Security Headers Analysis

This repository contains the results of analyzing website security headers for **Microsoft.com** and **Apple.com** using two online tools:  
- **SecurityHeaders.com** – checks presence and configuration of HTTP security headers.  
- **WhyNoPadlock.com** – checks HTTPS/SSL configuration and mixed content issues.  

## Summary

Website security headers are server instructions that help browsers enforce security policies. They protect against threats like **cross-site scripting (XSS)**, **clickjacking**, and **protocol downgrade attacks** by restricting how content is loaded and displayed.

Both Microsoft.com and Apple.com have strong **HTTPS/TLS encryption** and valid SSL certificates, ensuring secure data transmission. However, they are missing several recommended HTTP security headers that could provide an additional layer of protection.

## Key Findings

- **HTTPS Status:**  
  - Both sites enforce HTTPS.  
  - SSL certificates are valid and correctly configured.  
  - No mixed content issues were detected.  

- **Missing or Weak Headers:**  
  - **X-Frame-Options** → Prevents clickjacking attacks.  
  - **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** → Restricts resource loading, mitigates XSS.  
  - **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** → Forces browsers to use HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks.  
  - **X-XSS-Protection** → Offers basic XSS mitigation.  

- **Overall Security Grade:**  
  - Likely low to average due to absent headers (per SecurityHeaders.com results).  
  - HTTPS configuration itself is strong (per WhyNoPadlock.com results).  

## Conclusion

While encryption on both sites is solid, the absence of key HTTP security headers reduces browser-level protections. Adding these headers would harden defenses against common web attacks and improve overall security posture.
